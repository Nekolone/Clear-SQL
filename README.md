# Clear-SQL
#### sql to keep your sanity


##### This project is designed to maintain your psychological health in case you have to write longer SQL code than ```SELECT * FROM TableA```. It will simplify and speed up writing SQL functions, procedures, etc. Makes code readable and clean

The basic idea is to write code using a familiar C-like syntax, without using cumbersome and ugly constructions. Which will then be converted to standard SQL code that can be used in all supported DBMS. *(Initially it will be T-SQL only)*
